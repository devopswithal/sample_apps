      By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required
      to operate the "/manager/html" web application.  If you wish to use this app,
      you must define such a user - the username and password are arbitrary.

      Built-in Tomcat manager roles:
        - manager-gui    - allows access to the HTML GUI and the status pages
        - manager-script - allows access to the HTTP API and the status pages
        - manager-jmx    - allows access to the JMX proxy and the status pages
        - manager-status - allows access to the status pages only
    -->

    <user username="deployer" password="password2" roles="manager-script"/>
